This System is developed for managing the production to provide service to the manager or admin and workers without facing any problem. A production manager can manually maintain and keep track of the production chain and the work schedule. which is a tedious process and is time consuming. To address this issue, I adopt Pharmachine which offers the best service to the production manager of the company to get the best out of the manufacturing. This project will help the workers to get the direction from the manager directly, easily and efficiently.
